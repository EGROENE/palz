<h1>PALZ Portfolio Project</h1>
<p>Sick of feeling like a half-baked developer, having worked exclusively on the frontend side of things until this point, I decided to go rogue with a project originally started as an assignment for a coaching program, and take it much further than that assignment ever called for and turn this into the first-ever full-stack web application I built from scratch.</p>
<p>I built here a web app in which users can register accounts & use the app to organize IRL events, as well as chat & make friends with other users. There are some privacy settings that users can enable to control who can message them, send them friend requests, see their events, invite them to events, add them as organizers on events, and see their profile. Data is fetched only as needed so that the app runs as efficiently & quickly as possible, at least to the extent of my knowledge.</p>
